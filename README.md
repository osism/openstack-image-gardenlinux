# OpenStack Gardenlinux image

[Garden Linux](https://github.com/gardenlinux/gardenlinux) is a Debian derivate that
aims to provide a small, auditable linux image for most Cloud Providers and Bare Metal.

When a new tag/release is made on the [gardenlinux/gardenlinux](https://github.com/gardenlinux/gardenlinux)
repository, a new image is built and made available once.
